# ATLAS-cutter
Program used for cutting out sprites from sprite atlas, or sprite sheet
It is made with the Excellent 'Dear Imgui' found at: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki

It is made with VisualC 2017. It is windows only, but it can probably be compiled for Linux or Mac, since the Dear Imgui is cross platform enabled.
I have used the example with SDL2 and DirectX11.

The x64 option in the visualC IDE is not used, because it dont work for me.
So use Release or Debug x86 version.
